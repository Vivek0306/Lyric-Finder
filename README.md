# Lyric-Finder

## Working
A simple python program, that searches lyrics for the song that you entered.
This program uses python's Selenium library to search for the lyrics on google and displays the result either in a text file called 'lyrics.txt' or in the command line itself.

## Installation
Just download the program and run it.
You might need to install the **Chrome Driver** for working of the program. Check your Chrome version using the command `chrome://version/` in your Chrome. Get your chrome driver [here](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads).
> Update the (webdriver_path) variable in the program.

#### Enjoy the program and please feel free to give any feedbacks.
